## JIRA PROJECT
[JIRA AGILE CV PROJECT](https://bootcampqareyes.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CVP/boards/1)
This project is using JIRA tool for project management and defect traking following agile methodology SCRUM with 2 weeksÂ´s SPRINTS.

## TEST STRATEGY
This project adopts BDD Methodology for testing.

1. Test Design: Functional test scenarios are defined for each user story before development following BDD Methodology and using the Gherkin language, facilitated by the BDD Test Management Tool AssertThat for Jira.

2. Functional Test Execution and Bug Report: Functional test scenarios are executed manually on both Desktop and Mobile platforms for each new functionality. Any encountered bugs are promptly logged on JIRA and linked to the respective user story and test scenario. Comprehensive test results are documented using the test management tool.

4. Regression Test Execution: At the conclusion of each Sprint, regression test scenarios are manually executed on both Desktop and Mobile platforms. The outcomes of these tests are recorded using the test management tool.
5. Release has been created on JIRA at the end of each sprint with finished user stories.
