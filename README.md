## JIRA PROJECT
[JIRA AGILE CV PROJECT](https://bootcampqareyes.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CVP/boards/1)
This project is using JIRA tool for project management and defect traking following agile methodology SCRUM with 2 weeksÂ´s SPRINTS.

## TEST STRATEGY
This project adopts BDD Methodology for testing.

1. Test Design: Functional test scenarios are defined for each user story before development using the Gherkin language, facilitated by the Test Management Tool Zephyr Scale for Jira.

2. Functional Test Execution and Bug Report: Functional test scenarios are executed manually on both Desktop and Mobile platforms for each new functionality. Any encountered bugs are promptly logged on JIRA and linked to the respective user story and test scenario. Comprehensive test results are meticulously documented using Zephyr Scale.

4. Regression Test Execution: At the conclusion of each Sprint, regression test scenarios are manually executed on both Desktop and Mobile platforms. The outcomes of these tests are  recorded using Zephyr Scale.
